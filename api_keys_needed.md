I need to set up the OpenAI API key for AI meal planning functionality. Please enter your OpenAI API key below:

<lov-actions>
  <lov-secret-form name="OPENAI_API_KEY"></lov-secret-form>
</lov-actions>

I also need your Stripe secret key for subscription payments:

<lov-actions>
  <lov-secret-form name="STRIPE_SECRET_KEY"></lov-secret-form>
</lov-actions>

Once you've added these API keys, I'll complete the remaining features including:
- AI meal plan generation
- Recipe management with AI parsing
- Subscription billing with Stripe
- Smart grocery lists
- Affiliate tracking system
- Admin dashboard

Please add the API keys and let me know when they're configured!
